My tuppance.

I would say "NO" do not include ca-certificates; it's not required by everything, for example a self contained web server doesn't need them. Not even for "Lets Encrypt".

If you have a problem with downloading https then the suggestion of @tianon is simple if a public base is okay.

If not you can use the certificates of the Docker host to download with the Docker `ADD` command ...
```
ADD https://deb.debian.org/debian/pool/main/o/openssl/libssl1.1_1.1.1d-0+deb10u3_amd64.deb /root
ADD https://deb.debian.org/debian/pool/main/o/openssl/openssl_1.1.1d-0+deb10u3_amd64.deb /root
ADD https://deb.debian.org/debian/pool/main/c/ca-certificates/ca-certificates_20200601~deb10u1_all.deb /root
RUN dpkg --unpack /root/*.deb && dpkg --configure --pending && rm -f /root/*.deb
```

This uses the certificates of the Docker host machine.

It might be reasonable to provide an `ONBUILD ARG` with the exact URLs for this image.
